# Zero-Day Rescue

An interactive disaster-response rehearsal experience powered by **LingBot World 2** on Reactor. Operators navigate a generated earthquake site in real time, respond to evolving hazards, and complete a deterministic rescue mission while the world model renders the live environment.

This repository currently contains Reactor's official LingBot World 2 reference frontend as the working integration baseline, along with the Zero-Day Rescue research, build plan, and generated corridor reference image. The next implementation step is to reduce the reference UI to the focused **Aftershock** mission experience.

Everything runs through the strongly-typed
[`@reactor-models/lingbot-world-2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reactor-models/lingbot-world-2)
package, which wraps the base
[`@reactor-team/js-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reactor-team/js-sdk)
with typed commands, message hooks, and the `main_video` track view.

## Quick start

You'll need a Reactor API key — grab one at [reactor.inc/account/api-keys](https://www.reactor.inc/account/api-keys). It starts with `rk_`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# add your key: REACTOR_API_KEY=rk_...

pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), click **Connect**, then click one of the Quick Start examples. It uploads the scene's starting image, sends its composed prompt, and starts generating; from there the controls are live.

The API key never reaches the browser: the server route [`app/api/reactor/token/route.ts`](app/api/reactor/token/route.ts) exchanges it for a short-lived JWT scoped to `reactor/lingbot-world-2` sessions (via `authorization_details` — the token can only create sessions for that model and act on the sessions it created), and the SDK re-fetches it (via the browser's HTTP cache) on every API call through the `getJwt` resolver.

## What you can do with it

- **Quick Start examples.** Three curated scenes (a noir alley patrol, a battlefield horseman, a jet-ski cruise). One click uploads the image, sends the prompt, and starts.
- **Drive the world.** WASD (or the joystick) moves via `set_move_longitudinal` / `set_move_lateral`; arrows and click-to-engage mouse-look rotate via per-latent `set_camera_pose` deltas; Q/E roll; O toggles orbit (circle a point ahead instead of turning in place).
- **Trigger world events.** Each scene binds detail clauses to hold-keys 1–9 — hold to weave the event into the prompt, release to revert.
- **Jump and crouch** with selectable modes, from a simple prompt swap up to hand-editable per-step motion arcs (charge levels, dip patterns). The motion system is documented in [`skill/SKILL.md`](skill/SKILL.md).
- **Edit prompts live.** Click ✎ on any example to open the layered scene editor (base / camera / movement / events / vertical) — editing the running scene re-sends the prompt on the fly, and edits persist in `localStorage` until you press ↺. The **Show prompt** inspector (under Advanced) shows exactly what composed prompt the model is seeing and why.
- **Bring your own scene.** The Custom scene card takes your image plus a from-scratch layered prompt.
- **Backend knobs** (under Advanced): seed, rotation speed, DiT attention window, and KV-cache reset mode.
- **Snap a clip.** A "Capture" panel sits at the bottom of the sidebar. Click once and the SDK grabs the last 10 seconds of the live stream, opens a preview modal, and offers an MP4 download — no recording stack to wire up, no extra services.

## How the prompt is built

The model only ever sees a single prose string (`set_prompt`), but the app authors it in layers (`lib/lingbot-world-prompts.ts`):

- **base** — world identity: subject, environment, style
- **camera / movement** — each with `static` and `dynamic` variants, selected by whether you're currently moving
- **events** — hold-key detail clauses that stack while held
- **vertical** — the jump / crouch / stand sentence while those controls are engaged

`composePrompt()` flattens the active selection to prose and the controller re-sends it whenever the input state changes — so the text always matches the motion. The inspector panel visualizes this composition live.

## Configuration

| Env var                       | Required | What it does                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `REACTOR_API_KEY`             | yes      | Server-side key exchanged for session JWTs by `app/api/reactor/token/route.ts`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_COORDINATOR_URL` | no       | Reactor API base URL. Defaults to `https://api.reactor.inc`.                    |

If `REACTOR_API_KEY` is missing, the app renders a friendly setup landing instead of erroring — see [`app/SetupRequired.tsx`](app/SetupRequired.tsx).

## Going further

[`skill/SKILL.md`](skill/SKILL.md) is the deep dive for extending this app — the SDK's connection / events / messages model, the camera-pose channel rules, the layered prompt system and its override store, auth, and clip capture. Read it before adding controls or scenes.

Deferred features you could add next: a gamepad binding, free-text mid-stream prompt entry, multi-clip capture galleries, scheduled world events.
